Syntax files for ontology curators
==================================

This repository contains “syntax files” for some file formats used in
ontology editing and engineering.

## Syntax engines and tools
Currently, syntax files are provided for the following tools:

* the [Vim editor](https://www.vim.org/);
* LaTeX’s [listings package](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings).


## File formats
Syntax files are provided (for at least one of the syntax engines listed
above) for the following formats:

* the [RDF 1.1 Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) language;
* the [OWL 2 Functional-style Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/);
* the [OBO Flat File Format](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/obo-syntax.html);
* FlyBase’s “proforma” forms (not really an ontology format, but
  something I regularly use, so…).
